	<h1 style="font-family:Barrio;"> <a id="ap2"> More about us </a> </h1>
	</center>
		<p style="font-family:Barriecito; font-size:19px;"> Our school is one of the only two Schools that are located in our paper world, we started teaching a year after Paper School opened its doors to public. Since the first day in which we started teaching, we have been called the <b>'Rival School'</b> due to being the second school as many people may think that we want to rival with the success of the Paper School, though we are not in a rivalry against Paper School.
		<p style="font-family:Barriecito; font-size:19px;"> We want to also declare that we aren't making any rivalries between students from our schools, as we have heard that many parents think our school teaches our students to be bad or aggressive towards the kids from Paper School, we want to say that we don't make any of those rivalries happen, and most of them take place outside our facility, <u> we also are highly trying to talk with troublemakers from our school to calm down the situation</u>. We also want to say that we prepare some special activities with Paper School, letting the students from both schools socialize, we think that with that, things between both schools will get better.
		<p style="font-family:Barriecito; font-size:19px;"> We also want to adress some rumors, many people who said to have studied in our school, talk about different dissapareances, injuries or death. They all talk about an entity named <b> DANIEL </b>, which is called as that to mean: <u><i> Dangerous, Aggressive, Negative, Inmortal, Enigmatic and Lurking</u></i>. We want to say that this 'Daniel' is just a myth from our school, as there haven't been any proven ideas of that thing actually existing, we may think that it may be kids having <u>traumatic experiences</u> about something and thinking this creature is real, though, we thought that it may be other people who just make-up these little things to scare the kids and drag bad attention to us, but we want to assure you,<b> our school is safe for all</b>, including students and teachers.
	<center>
		<p style="font-family:Barriecito; font-size:19px;"> <small> For legal issues, <mark>parents will need to sign a legal disclamer releasing us from all liability that may happen to their kids while they stay in our school </mark>, but as we said before, our school is safe and we highly doubt that any of those things will actually happen. </small>
